      <description>Hello, Today we are going to learn about the Prims algorithm of finding a minium spanning tree. If you donâ€™t know what is a minium spanning tree then please go and study about it on this blog post.
So Prims algoritms says that start from a random vertex from tree put it in tree. Find all the neighbours of all the nodes in the tree excluding the one&amp;rsquo;s which are already in the tree.</description>

The krushkal&amp;rsquo;s aglorithm says that you have to pick the edge
 which has least weight in the graph, wont make cycle in the tree  And after that pick the next edge which is second lightest in weight, then third, then fourth&amp;hellip;.</description>
