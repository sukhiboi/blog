      <description>Hello,
Today, we will learn about data types in C. So what are types?
To understand it better, let&amp;rsquo;s see what&amp;rsquo;s variable. Variable is just a virtual box that can hold some stuff. In computing that, stuff is some data, like Integer (3, 4) or character (&amp;lsquo;s&amp;rsquo;), etc. So data type is property/attribute of that box which specify which kind of stuff/data this box can hold.
There are many different types.</description>

      <description>Hello,
I know you came here to understand how to write a C program. But before we write a C program, I think first we should learn some basic things about C.
Well C was developed by Dennis M. Ritchie and first implemented in 1972 at Bell Labs. C is a language that deals with low-level stuff like memory, but the exciting part is that it is written in a high-level language.</description>
