        <p>Hello,<br>
I know you came here to understand how to write a C program. But before we write a C program, I think first we should learn some basic things about C.</p>
<p>Well C was developed by Dennis M. Ritchie and first implemented in 1972 at Bell Labs. C is a language that deals with low-level stuff like memory, but the exciting part is that it is written in a high-level language. Any programming language is called HLL (High-Level Language), when it&rsquo;s code is easier to read by humans. C is a high-level language. This concludes that the code of C is pretty easy to read and understand.</p>
<p>For now, this much knowledge is sufficient, let&rsquo;s do some digging in the working world.</p>
<p>A file which contains a C program will always have an extension of <strong>.c</strong>, for example, <strong>example.c</strong></p>
<p>What can be the simplest program to write in C? Yes, you are correct. The simplest program will be to print something on the screen.</p>
<p>Let us go step by step to write a C program that will print &ldquo;Hello&rdquo; on the screen.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1</strong><br>
Open any text editor in your computer and then type the following code in the editor and save the file as &ldquo;hello.c&rdquo; to any directory/folder you like.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span style="color:#75715e">#include</span> <span style="color:#75715e">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span><span style="color:#75715e">
</span><span style="color:#75715e"></span>
<span style="color:#66d9ef">int</span> <span style="color:#a6e22e">main</span>(<span style="color:#66d9ef">void</span>)
{
    printf(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Hello&#34;</span>);
    <span style="color:#66d9ef">return</span> <span style="color:#ae81ff">0</span>;
};
</code></pre></div><p>We will understand this code in a bit.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2</strong><br>
Open up your terminal, and go to that directory and run the following commands.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">$ gcc hello.c
$ ./a.out
</code></pre></div><p>Once you run the second command, WOW suddenly &ldquo;Hello&rdquo; appears on the screen. Now you know how to run a C program. Now let&rsquo;s take a look at what happened behind the scenes.</p>
<p>At our first step, we wrote some code. Let&rsquo;s understand the meaning of each line and what each line is doing.</p>
<p><strong>Line 1</strong></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span style="color:#75715e">#include</span> <span style="color:#75715e">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span><span style="color:#75715e">
</span></code></pre></div><p>In this line, we are telling C, &ldquo;<em>Hey C, I want some help from a friend of yours, i.e., stdio. Can you call him please</em> &ldquo;.</p>
<p>Actually stdio stands for <strong>ST</strong>an<strong>D</strong>ard <strong>I</strong>nput <strong>O</strong>utput. <strong>stdio.h</strong> is a file that contains some functions which deal with input and output devices. So as we are printing something on the screen, which means that we want C to use/interact with the screen, which is an output device.</p>
<p>So, the gist of this whole para is that C will allow our program to access the function of stdio.h to use the screen, specifically in this program, it will enable us to print something on the screen.</p>
<p><strong>Line 2</strong></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c"><span style="color:#66d9ef">int</span> main(<span style="color:#66d9ef">void</span>)
</code></pre></div><p>This is an interesting line. On this line, we start telling C what we want to do. I know you have some questions regarding what is <strong>int</strong> and <strong>void</strong>, we will cover them in the upcoming posts. For now, assume that this is the starting point from which we have to write the actual code.</p>
<p>You notice these things in the code we wrote to <strong>hello.c</strong></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c">{

}
</code></pre></div><p>These are called a block. You have to write your code in these blocks. Here <strong>{</strong> open parenthesis means <strong>start of the block</strong> and <strong>}</strong> close parenthesis means <strong>end of the block</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Line 3</strong></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c">printf(<span style="color:#e6db74">&#34;Hello&#34;</span>)
</code></pre></div><p>Aha!! This is the most crucial line in the code we wrote. This is the line that tells C to print something on the screen. So how printf works. Well, the answer is simple; you have to call printf. You have to write printf then call it with <strong>brackets ()</strong> and tell it to print a word in double <strong>quotes &ldquo;&quot;</strong></p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Interesting Fact</strong><br>
printf is the reason why we included stdio.h. We are using printf, which lives in stdio.h.</p>
<hr>
<p>I know we skipped line 4 because I think this is not the right time to dive into that stuff. For now, we should assume that you need to write that line after you write code.</p>
<p>So this is all about the code. Now let&rsquo;s understand what happens when we ran those other commands in the terminal.</p>
<p><strong>Command 1</strong></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">gcc hello.c
</code></pre></div><p>The first thing that hits the mind is what is <strong>gcc</strong>. Well, for now, think of gcc as a person who is responsible for checking your code that whether it&rsquo;s correct or not. If your code has problems, it will show error(s). <strong>If not, then it will generate another file that your computer understands</strong>. This whole process is known as <strong>compilation</strong>. When you run this command, it will compile your code and create another file written in machine-level code (which is the only computer can understand, specifically the computer which compiles the code). By default gcc always generate a file named as <strong>a.out</strong></p>
<p><strong>Command 2</strong></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-bash" data-lang="bash">./a.out
</code></pre></div><p>At this point, your code is converted to machine-level code, and your computer can understand. Now we just need to run it. So this command will run that machine-level code and shows you the output.</p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s all. Well, now you know how to write a simple C program that prints something on the screen.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading.</p>
